# TODO

Add pageniation ie: the auto removal of table and update of values that is done for List of Playlists
to the sublists and the main page

Next add an option to list and show vidoes that are not associated with any Playlists to do this update the
listing to add the reference to the vidoes that are not associated with any Playlists as to be associated with
none this will make querying easier

Alternatively there can be a way to query vidoes whos url and reference are same seems stupid tho.

Add the socket.io javascript to being locally served

Test traefik with socket and then port the entire thing

Also find a way to make the downloads work in parallel but only 3||n running parallelly

Next add a way to update the playlist UpdatedAt when the playlist is updated or re-encountered

Lastly find a way to change the status of vidoes in the Available column when they are found to be
removed or something when re-checking the playlist

Thats is add a way to re-check the playlist after a few weeks (or as specified by the user) form the last
UpdatedAt time of the playlist.

Package all fucntion in client.js and then ship it as an asset

Also minify the code (JK who would need it to be like that, it's not like anyone's going to use it anyway)
