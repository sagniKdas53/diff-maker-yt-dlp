# Todo

1. Fit the clear and download buttons somewhere
2. Make sure that any function that loads new data unchecks the `<input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox"
                            value="" id="selector" aria-label="...">`
3. Add a way to render the table such that it has appropriate tints
   1. green background if the vidoe is downloaded
   2. Red if it's unavailable (ie deleted)
   3. Yellow background if it's privated
4. Add these to the main page and also make the main page responsive using `container-fluid`
5. Maybe add the table sorting feature using bootstrap-table js
