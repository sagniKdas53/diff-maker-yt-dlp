# Todo

1. [ ] Fix the issue with unlisted vidoes being so hard to find, they need proper indexing to not be a mess
   1. The idea is simple either make the indexing increase every time or
   2. Make a separate table for the unlisted videos there they can have autoincrementing indexes and if they are infact added to any playlist they can just be removed leaving a blank index
   3. Which during manintaincance can be fixed
2. [ ] The nav-icon and text are not propeerly aligned (I believe)
3. [x] Handle youtube channels
4. [ ] Test if chunking is working properly
5. [ ] Add a way to add videos to multiple playlists
6. [ ] Maybe add the table sorting feature using bootstrap-table js
